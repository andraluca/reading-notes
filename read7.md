These are all pretty pictures and metaphores to offer a user friendly explanation of how JavaScript works - similar to the robot exercise - which by the way went well for me, I did not have to re write any of my instructions, and I included hoodie location and access, opening zipper, sleeves too long, etc.

## Expressions
- evaluate a single value,
- or they use multiple values to return a single value

## Operators - what expressions rely on

- assignment operators:  asign a value to a variable
- arithmic operators - for basic math
- string operators - combine 2 strings
- comparison operators - compare 2 values and return a true or false
logical operators - combine expressions and return true or false

## Functions
Functions allow you to group multiple statements to perform a task.  They can be re-used rather then re-written.

### How to declare a function:

1. give it a name
2. write the statements in curly brackets

### How to call a function

1. use function name ollowed by parentheses.

Sometimes **functions** need specific info to perform task:  parameters are called variable.

When calling **functions** that need information, you specify values inside the parenthesis.  You may also variables instead of specifying values.
