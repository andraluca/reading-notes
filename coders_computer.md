# Reading assignment 02 - Choosing a Text Editor

Choosing a Text Editor is an important place to start your coding journey.  There are plenty of options, and you just need to decide which is your prefered flavor. The editor will help a coder run and manage text.  Here are some important features to look for:
1.  code completion
2.  syntax highlighting
3.  theme variety
4.  variety of add-on extensions

Options to choose from:

1.  text editors that come with your computer:  very basic, not ideal
2.  third party options - each equipped with great features - such as:
    1.  NotePad++
    2.  Sublime Text
    3.  Brackets
    4.  Atom
    5.  Visual Studio Code
    6.  BB Edit  


# My first Lab:

1.  **Growth Mindset** - a few things I understand about the growth mindset:
  - it is the opposite of a fixed mindset
  - it is a constructive mindset that leads to growth
  - it is a mindset that leads to creativity because it it not afraid to fail
  
2.  **Growth Practice**  -  I tend to fall within more of a fixed mindset, and *growing away* from that is a practice I tend to every day
  - When I start feeling uncomfortable when faced with being about to fail, I remind myself that I am presented with an opportunity for learning.
  - I am actively seeking dead ends when I have time on my hands just to practice what it feels like to have to retrace my steps.
  - I am happy to learn from others' successes and accept that behing behind those with more experience is precisely the right place to be.
