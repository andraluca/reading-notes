# Growth Mindset

A few things I understand about the growth mindset:

  - it is the opposite of a fixed mindset
  - it is a constructive mindset that leads to growth
  - it is a mindset that leads to creativity because it it not afraid to fail
  
# Growth Practice

I tend to fall within more of a fixed mindset, and *growing away* from that is a practice I tend to every day, here are some tips:

  - When I start feeling uncomfortable when faced with imminent fail, I remind myself that I am presented with an opportunity for learning - definitely easier said than done, and it is ok to fail.  Trying counts and builds muscle memory.

  - I am actively seeking dead ends when I have time on my hands just to practice what it feels like to have to retrace my steps.

  - I am happy to learn from others' successes and accept that behing behind those with more experience is precisely the right place to be.
