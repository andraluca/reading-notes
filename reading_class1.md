**GitHub** is a great place to learn basic coding and to see what others are doing which may prove not only helpful but inspirational at the same time

Make sure to follow along with their instructional demo and pay attention to the quick reference list of GitHub *syntax*.

Markdown is essentially a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

The actual syntax I am hoping needs not be memorized.  I presume some commands will be easier to remember than others, and none without lots of practice.
