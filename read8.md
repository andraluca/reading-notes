# Evaluating Conditions

You compare one value in the script to what you expect it to be.

== Compares 2 values to see if they are the same (is equal to)

!= compares 2 values to see if they are NOT the same (is not equal to)

=== compares 2 vaues to check that both data and data type are the same (strict equal to)

!== compares 2 vaues to check that both data and data type are NOT the same (strict not equal to)

- greater than > 
- less than <
- greater than or equal to >=
- less than or equal to <=

All 4 above are self-explanatory.

# LOGICAL OPERATORS

Comparing operators return single values of True or False.  **Logical Operators** allow you to compare more than 2 operators.
