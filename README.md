# My first reading assignment:

1.  **GitHub** is a great place to learn basic coding and to see what others are doing which may prove not only helpful but inspirational at the same time

2.  They even include a quick reference list of their **syntax**.

3.  Markdown is essentially is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

4.  The actual syntax I am hoping needs not be memorized.  I presume some commands will be easier to remember than others, and none without lots of practice.  


# My learning Journal for June 22

1.  **Growth Mindset** - a few things I understand about the growth mindset:
  - it is the opposite of a fixed mindset
  - it is a constructive mindset that leads to growth
  - it is a mindset that leads to creativity because it it not afraid to fail
  
2.  **Growth Practice**  -  I tend to fall within more of a fixed mindset, and *growing away* from that is a practice I tend to every day
  - When I start feeling uncomfortable when faced with being about to fail, I remind myself that I am presented with an opportunity for learning.
  - I am actively seeking dead ends when I have time on my hands just to practice what it feels like to have to retrace my steps.
  - I am happy to learn from others' successes and accept that behing behind those with more experience is precisely the right place to be.
