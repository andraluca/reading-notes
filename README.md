# My learning Journal for June 22

1.  **Growth Mindset** - a few things I understand about the growth mindset:
  - it is the opposite of a fixed mindset
  - it is a constructive mindset that leads to growth
  - it is a mindset that leads to creativity because it it not afraid to fail
  
2.  **Growth Practice**  -  I tend to fall within more of a fixed mindset, and *growing away* from that is a practice I tend to every day
  - When I start feeling uncomfortable when faced with a debaucle, I remind myself that I am presented with an opportunity for learning.
  - I am activeliy seeking dead ends when I have time on my hands just to practice what it feels like to have to retrace my steps.
  - I am happy to learn from others' successes and accept that behing behind those with more experience is precisely the right place to be.
